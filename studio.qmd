## Concepts

### L13_512_64_base19 Jacquard Sweater

I trained a GAN and explored internal neuron activations as a “design space”; the final face-like motif came from those activation patterns. The design is embedded in a 4-colour yarn-dyed jacquard fully-fashioned sweater of Extrafine Merino Wool.

### Delete Tee

This heavyweight t-shirt features a design of a 90s beige "Delete" key on a soothing blue fabric. This key, seemingly simple, carries the weight of transformation. A blend of vintage aesthetics and contemporary fashion, the Delete Tee is a reminder that every end births a start.

### Certainty Tee

The Certainty Tee is a heavyweight red t-shirt featuring a gradual list of levels of certainty, progressing from "Yes" to "Definitely Not." From absolute confidence to hesitant ambiguity, and the finality of "Impossibly," the Certainty Tee takes you on a journey through the nuances of assurance and doubt.

### Diffusion2023 Tee

This pale heather gray heavyweight t-shirt is the first I've made. The design showcases a heart-shaped jewel box adorned with "AS" breloques.
