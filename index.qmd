## Bio

::: {.cardish}
👋 I’m Pascal Jutras‑Dubé, a PhD student in Computer Science at Purdue University (advised by [Ruqi Zhang](https://ruqizhang.github.io){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}).  I study sampling and generative modeling through learned stochastic processes, like diffusions and jump processes, and their applications.  

Outside the lab, I co-founded [Almost Surely](https://almost-surely.com){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a fashion brand for the geek community.
And when I need a reset, I make fresh pasta: flour, eggs, a little patience: an experiment you can taste.

**Now seeking:** Summer 2026 research / applied scientist PhD internships (ML, generative modeling, sampling, planning, statistics).
