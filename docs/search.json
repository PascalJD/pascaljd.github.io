I study sampling and generative modeling through learned stochastic processes, like diffusions and jump processes, and their applications. I’m currently interested in the theoretical foundations, parallel decoding, test-time alignment, and multimodality of diffusion large language models (dLLMs).\nOutside the lab, I co-founded Almost Surely, a fashion brand for the geek community. And when I need a reset, I make fresh pasta: flour, eggs, a little patience: an experiment you can taste.\nNow seeking: Summer 2026 research / applied scientist PhD internships (ML, generative modeling, sampling, planning, statistics)."

The design is embedded in a 4-colour yarn-dyed jacquard fully-fashioned sweater of Extrafine Merino Wool.\n\n\n\nDelete Tee\nThis heavyweight t-shirt features a design of a 90s beige “Delete” key on a soothing blue fabric. This key, seemingly simple, carries the weight of transformation. A blend of vintage aesthetics and contemporary fashion, the Delete Tee is a reminder that every end births a start.\n\n\n\nCertainty Tee\nThe Certainty Tee is a heavyweight red t-shirt featuring a gradual list of levels of certainty, progressing from “Yes” to “Definitely Not.” From absolute confidence to hesitant ambiguity, and the finality of “Impossibly,” the Certainty Tee takes you on a journey through the nuances of assurance and doubt. \n\n\nDiffusion2023 Tee\nThis pale heather gray heavyweight t-shirt is the first I’ve made. The design showcases a heart-shaped jewel box adorned with “AS” breloques."
